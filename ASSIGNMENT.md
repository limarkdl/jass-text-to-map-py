You need to implement the visualization for given road map, infrastructure objects and cars. In file data.txt you have a text matrix which can contain the following symbols:
 *  S -- side walk
 *  R -- Road
 *  C -- car
 *  G -- grass
 *  B -- building
 *  P -- parking place
 *  T -- traffic light

Your program should be able to read the file and convert it to the image file map.png, containing the visualization for the road map symbols. There is no special requirements for particular way how the symbols should look like. In simplest case it can be just squares of different colors. See the example below.

#### Example

Sample input

RRRRRRCRRRCRRRCRRRRR
