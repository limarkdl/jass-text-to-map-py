## Using application üñ•Ô∏è

After it's started, you can see a CLI interface. Follow the instructions and when you are supposed to enter
the data, do it line by line. After you are done, the program will generate a file called ```output.png``` in the ```/task2/``` folder and show it.

1. Sticky sidewalks - all sidewalks are following the road and are not separated from it, as close as possible
2. Parking borders - all parking slots have an automatic border to show the parking area
3. Automatic road curves detection - the program detects the road curves and draws it accordingly
4. Prediction of background of a car - the program predicts if the background of the car is a 'Parking' or a 'Road' and draws it accordingly
5. Aligned cars - all cars are aligned to the road. At crossroads angle is random
6. Pattern / Position randomization - the program randomizes the pattern of the buildings, sidewalks, grass, so it looks more interesting
